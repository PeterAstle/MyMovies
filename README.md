MyMovies API 

  MyMovies is an API made for logging personalized movie data to allow for favorite movies and custom rating applied to each movie.  
  The user can add new movies by movie title, genre, add a mark for favorite or would watch again.  
  
  At the time this repository is not available to clone but reach out to ask any questions.
